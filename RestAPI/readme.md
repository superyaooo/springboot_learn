# React and Spring Data Rest tutorial (https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/)

The original tutorial is a Maven project that uses <em>frontend-maven-plugin</em> to take care of webpack and all the node.js tools. 
Since I prefer Gradle, I turned the tutorial project into a Gradle project. The build.gradle shows how to handle webpack and node.js tools in a Gradle project.

// TODO - node and npm now installs automatically; need to figure out webpack install error
